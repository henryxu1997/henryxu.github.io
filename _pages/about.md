Welcome to my personal website. I am a Research Assistant at the **MIT Sloan School of Management**, currently advised by **Professors David Rand**, **Gordan Pennycook**, and **Thomas Costello**. My broad interests lie in **Computational Social Science** and **Machine Learning**.

My research focuses on understanding mechanisms of persuasion and belief formation through computational and experimental methods. 

**Mechanisms of Persuasion**: I use AI-enabled personalized dialogues as a methodological tool to systematically study belief formation and attitude change.

**Computational Methods for Social Sciences**: I develop novel analytical pipelines combining NLP and machine learning to analyze experimental data in social science. My work includes building targeted measurement tools for persuasion strategies, uncovering hidden behavioral patterns in dialogues, and creating frameworks to validate experimental manipulations.

Before coming to MIT, I completed my master's at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by **Professor Patrick Park**. My research there examined how strong pre-existing social ties on Twitter could maintain relationships despite differing views on controversial topics, demonstrating that these connections could serve as bridges across ideological divides.

Before grad school, I worked on anomaly detection in IoT networks at the **University of Toronto** with **Professors Alberto Leon-Garcia** and **Mehdi Shajari**. I completed my undergraduate degree in **Computer Engineering** at the same university, where I published work on microservices orchestration with Professor Leon-Garcia.

Professionally, I've gained diverse software engineering experience at **Telus, Coursera, Amazon, and Xilinx**, where I developed and implemented practical solutions across various projects.
