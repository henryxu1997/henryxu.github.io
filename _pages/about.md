Welcome to my personal website (still under construction). I am a Master's student at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, currently advised by Professors Kathleen Carley, Patrick Park, and Bogdan Vasilescu. My broad interests lie in Machine Learning and Computational Social Science.

My current research focuses on studying the digital factors that enable or inhibit civil communication on social media. Specifically, I aim to investigate individuals' capacity to freely share their views and build relationships in online discourse, with a particular emphasis on the multimodal dynamics of emotions.

Meaningful Self-Expression: I seek to understand the factors that influence peopleâ€™s ability to share their views freely and to identify ways to remove barriers to this through thoughtful platform and policy design.

Emotional Dynamics in Online Discourse: I am interested in analyzing the mechanisms by which different content modalities on social media impact user beliefs in misinformation and contribute to political polarization.

Before grad school, I worked on anomaly detection in IoT devices at the University of Toronto, collaborating with Professors Alberto Leon-Garcia and Mehdi Shajari. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at the same university, publishing work on microservices orchestration with Professor Alberto Leon-Garcia.

Professionally, I've gained diverse software engineering experience at Telus, Coursera, Amazon, and Xilinx, focusing on developing and implementing practical solutions across various projects.
